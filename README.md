# Traffic Simulator

This web application provides tools to build traffic simulations.

## Project Goals

* Provide functionality for users to draw and connect various road types.
* Experiment with different intersection designs and parameters
* Simulate autonomous driving vehicles that are aware of precision positions and intended paths of all other cars.
  * The purpose of this is to demonstrate how traffic flow can be improved via global car data.
* Provide metrics to determine efficiencies of particular road designs.
